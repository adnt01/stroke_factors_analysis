# stroke_factors_analysis
Cohot8 - DS3
##### Goal: Determine top 3 factors - lifestyle or health -  for stroke prediction. 


### Week1 Expectations 

1. The business motivation for your project.
2. Which dataset you have chosen to use.
3. Risks or unknowns that you have identified.

* Initial exploratory data analysis revealed that the dataset is highly unbalanced. Only 249 observations (~5%) are positive for stroke. Limited positive cases for both training and test dataset.  
* Region: we do not know the geographical location of the individuals surveyed. Results may not generalize well to populations living in a different geographical location. 
* Ethnicity: we do not know the ethnicity of the individuals surveyed. If all data came from one ethnicity group, results may not generalize well to a different ethnicity group.
* Time - we do not know the timeline in which the data is collected. Medical definitions and technologies can change over time. 
* Missing important medical factors such as cholesterol level and diabetes status (7).  
* Missing data for Body Mass Index for some individuals/observations: requires imputation. 

4. How you will approach the analysis.
5. Breakdown of roles/tasks assigned to each team member.

### README REQUIREMENT
Each project's README should describe the project objective, the final outcome of
the project, the key business takeaways, and describe your team's approach to
working collaboratively.

### Guiding Questions

* Who is the intended audience for your project?
* What is the question you will answer with your analysis?
* What are the key variables and attributes in your dataset?
* Do you need to clean your data, and if so what is the best strategy?
* How can you explore the relationships between different variables?
* What types of patterns or trends are in your data?
* Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to your project requirements?

In addition, you should be considering the following (depending on your stream):

**Data Science Guiding Questions**

* How can you tailor the visualizations to effectively communicate with your audience?
* What type of visualization best suits your data and objectives (e.g., bar chart, scatter plot, heatmap)?
* How can you iterate on your design to address feedback and make improvements?
* What best practices can you follow to promote inclusivity and diversity in our visualization design?
* How can you ensure that your visualization accurately represents the underlying data without misleading or misinterpreting information?
* Are there any privacy concerns or sensitive information that need to be addressed in your visualization?
